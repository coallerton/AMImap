# How "Affordable" is that Housing?

This project analyzes true local affordability of "affordable housing" in New York City. By pulling affordable housing development data and neigborhood median income data, affordable housing rents are compared to what local income earners can pay for rent.

Sources include the American Community Survey (2016-2020 5-Year Estimates) and the NYC Open Data Portal. Data is stored in Postgres and analyzed in R. The website can be viewed at https://coallerton.github.io/AMImap/amimap.html.
